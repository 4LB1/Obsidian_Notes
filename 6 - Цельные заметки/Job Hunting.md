# Job Hunting

The whole idea of the topic is brought from the point that a job is a hard-to-get thing, especially in the giant field of IT. So is it really that hard?
I've never had an opportunity to apply for a job, so my personal opinion would be based only on the texts from Oral Speech book and little bits of experience of my friends.
So what things we need to develop and remember to succeed in job hunting:
0. On the best situation shall be, when not you are searching for a job, but jobs are searching for you. So, how can this be possible? Well? first of all it is about Networking: you gain or already have a person, who knows you and can grant you a place somewhere to work in. Second is about you having enough experience and skills, that only your resume is a point to many great companies. And third is for people with specific sphere, where their knowledge of even the most basics is great for the employer.
So, returning to the Earth, what can we do to increase our chances to get a decent job:
1. First we need to determine spheres we have skills and talents in and consider to search for a company that searches employees for a position in the field you're good at. And from now on we're collecting max info about the company and the position you may hit. Does it fit your preferences and skills? Also the authority the company has also matters. It won't be good if you would not be paid salary:)
2. Once we decided, try to message the HR or even telephone them and ask for an interview.
3. On the interview we need to look professionally to the limit:
	- Be calm as possible, polite, neat and tidy
	- Listen carefully and take your time to respond well
	- Prepare your CV in the final state and make sure it reached the HR(the company)
	- Also you can train some typical questions, shall they not discourage you
4. Speaking about your Resume. People often either make something too standard, or dive into unnecessary details often not connected to the context of a job resume. So I'd mention some rules I find working when making a resume:
	- Cut the fluff and keep only the key points.
	- Accent not the places you were at, but the projects you made and skills you gained
	- Also you can use general info(hobbies, nonwork activities) to show your soft skills and support why do you think you're confident, for example.
	- Show in the Resume why do you want to get on to this position and how you will be helpful for a company. Or generally explain your choice in the field you have been working or interested in.

As for me and my personnel, most of the information is in the CV, and I'd mention some of my key features and skills.
First of all, I am a generalist more than a professional(ist), so deep and hard thinking work for the long run is not my piece of cake. With regard to me having some team work and leadership skills, I'd count on a team-lead position or something like that. By the way, I find myself easily teachable - I am very opened for something new, so even if I didn't have enough skills for some task, I would learn the skills needed fast and efficiently. 
Speaking about my weaknesses, I am a bit lazy and my workflow is quite impulsive, BUT still it doesn't mean that I fail deadlines, I have discipline and responsibility for making the job done in time and with a decent quality.
All my life I've been absent-minded, always forgot some details, small tasks, objects and so on. Now I'm building my own system for memorizing and processing my life, like "second brain".
